## Presentations

These are the talks that I have decided to give in order to share my excitement for game development, functional programming, and data science.

## Goal

Initially give talks at meetups. As I gain more confidence, apply to give at least two talks at a major JavaScript Conference by the end of this year

## Affiliation

Most of the talks that I am presenting were all based on side projects that I worked on during my glorious time at the Recurse Center.
